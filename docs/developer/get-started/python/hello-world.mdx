        # define your attributes here

```

Lets start from this Python 3 program. It is declared class `Strategy`, and this class inhirited from the systm built-in class `StrategyBase`.
During constructing `Strategy` would execute `__init__(self)` to set up `period`, `subscribed_books`, and `options` attributes.

- period: To set up strategy execute period with the unit as second. **Once initialized the period could not be changed.**
- subscribed_books: No need to change in trading single pair strategy. If developing multiple pairs strategy, set up exchange and pairs here.
- options: **No need to change here.** 

`Strategy` includes belows 2 methods.
- on_order_state_change(self, order): When the order status is changed, the system would pass (`order`) to call this method.
- trade(self, candles): During each period, system would pass the latest price and volume data (`candles`) to call this method.

In this example, it uses `CA.get_exchange_pair()` to get the name of exchange, pair, base, and quote. By using exchange, pair to get the latest close price in candles.
`candles[exchange][pair]` is the array type of K bar, and it is sorted from the latest to the oldest data with at most 500 records data. The K bar includes below information.
```
    open
    high 
    low
    close
    volume
    time
```

It is used `CA.log()` in the last sentence of `trade()` to print out the string `'Hello world! Current price is {}'.format(close_price)`. After backtesting, the print out messages would be showed in the records.
